## Imputation üêÅ
The [`mice`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=mice) package
implements a method to deal with missing data. The package creates
multiple imputations (replacement values) for multivariate missing
data. The method is based on Fully Conditional Specification, where
each incomplete variable is imputed by a separate model. The `MICE`
algorithm can impute mixes of continuous, binary, unordered
categorical and ordered categorical data. In addition, MICE can impute
continuous two-level data, and maintain consistency between
imputations by means of passive imputation. Many diagnostic plots are
implemented to inspect the quality of the imputations.

  - **Method**: 
    1. Concatenate the multiple imputed data sets and optimize an SVM classifier in the resulting set; this not only accounts for the variability of the parameter estimates but also for the variability of the training observations in relation to the imputed values.  (IMI Algorithm) In the first algorithm the training data set was imputed m times, merged into a single large data set, and then used to train a classifier, SVM in this case. Test data set was then concatenated with the stacked training data set, imputed m times, and extracted from the training samples for prediction. Each of the m now complete test data sets were used for prediction using the classifier that was trained in the previous step. Therefore, for each sample in the test data set, m predictions were produced and a majority vote was used to form the final prediction for each test sample.  
    2.  A more standard procedure, involves fitting separate SVMs to each imputed data set and get the pooled (i.e., averaged) performance of the different SVMs.   In the second algorithm, training data was again imputed m times and for each of the complete data sets, a classifier was trained. Test data set was then concatenated with each of the m imputed training data sets, imputed once (i.e. m=1) and then used for prediction. Again, m predictions were produced and a majority vote was used to form the final prediction.  
  - The IMI algorithm was determined to work generally better.
  - **Notes**: Two general principles should be kept in mind for performing MI at test time:
    1. Imputation of test data must be done in test time, that is, it is not possible to do the imputation of all data altogether (training and test). 
    2. When imputing the missing values in test data, it is not possible to use the class (target) variable for the imputation (only the predictors can be used).
